        <main>
            <p>Hey there! My name is Jacob Amsbury. I am a fun person to get along with, however I do enjoy electronics more than people. I myself enjoy playing videogames, collecting Magic: The gathering cards, listening to music, and meeting new faces. Growing up I was shy and bullied, thus I turned to machines, since then I have been learning how to use a computer, and even started coding. As for work, I have a lot of experience in customer service, having worked in fastfood and sales. I was an assistant manager at the restaraunts I worked at, and the same went for the sales posiion I have worked. My goals are a little ambitious I think, but i am certain I can achieve them! I am gunning for a job at a videogame developer like for example, Blizzard or Microsoft.</p>
